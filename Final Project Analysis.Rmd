# Final Project Analysis

## Introduction

This project analyzes student spending patterns and their relationship to the cost of living across different regions.

```{r Load Data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(GGally)
library(purrr)

# Import student spending data
spending <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dangsteve/STAT184/main/student_spending.csv")
cost_of_living <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dangsteve/STAT184/main/advisorsmith_cost_of_living_index.csv")

# Inspect datasets
str(spending)
summary(spending)

str(cost_of_living)
summary(cost_of_living)
```

```{r Load Data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Compute average cost of living
average_cost_of_living <- cost_of_living %>%
  summarise(avg_cost_of_living = mean(Cost.of.Living.Index, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  pull(avg_cost_of_living)

# Add average cost of living to the spending dataset
spending <- spending %>%
  mutate(average_cost_of_living = average_cost_of_living)

# Create additional variables for analysis
spending <- spending %>%
  mutate(
    total_income = monthly_income + financial_aid,
    total_spending = (tuition / 4) + housing + food + transportation +
      books_supplies + entertainment + personal_care +
      technology + health_wellness + miscellaneous
  )

# Summarize data by gender
